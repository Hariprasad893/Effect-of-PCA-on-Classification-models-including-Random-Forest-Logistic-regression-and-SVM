# Effect-of-PCA-on-Classification-models-including-Random-Forest-Logistic-regression-and-SVM
This is a project which focuses on the how reducing the dimensions of the data set (specifically the MNIST Handwritten digit data) will impact the performance of classification models.
The MNIST Handwritten digit data set consists of images of handwritten digits, each image is 28 pixels wide and 28 pixels in height. Hence the total number of pixels in an image will be 784
Each pixel value in the data set consists of how bright/dark it is, with 0 being the lightest and 255 being the darkest.
In total there are 70,000 images. As this is a kaggle competition titled 'Digit Recognizer', the data was downloaded from Kaggle and hence it is already split up into 42000 training images and 28000 test images.
